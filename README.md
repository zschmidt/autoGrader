# Python AutoGrader


This repo holds the development of a auto grading (and real-time feedback) tool for Python code.


Using Travis CI.



## Description of Directories


Each subdirectory has its own README.md, but the high level overview is as follows:

* `client/` only holds one HTML page, which itself holds the button to allow access for the app in general
* `documentation/` holds a basic outline of how we're committing to GitHub via the API... it's rather convoluted
* `server/` is the largest subdirectory, but generally holds anything that the server needs to run
* `validationRepos/` holds a number of subdirectories, one per module
